# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The On-Chain Disc Golf team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/GarrettGlass/On-Chain-Disc-Golf/security/advisories/new)

- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:

- Authorized concerning any applicable anti-hacking laws

- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service that would interfere with conducting security research

We will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for accidental, good-faith violations of this policy.

# 🥏 On-Chain Disc Golf

> *"We'll settle up after the round!"* — Famous last words.

**On-Chain Disc Golf** is a disc golf scorecard app with integrated Bitcoin payments. No banks. No IOUs. No "Venmo is acting weird." Automatic round settlement, instant and hassle-free.

Ironically, despite the name, all payments are actually *off-chain*. ;)

## ⚠️ Early Access Software

**This app is in active development.** While we've done our best to make it reliable, bugs happen. The wallet functionality involves real Bitcoin.

**Please exercise caution:**
- Start with small amounts until you're comfortable
- Back up your nsec (secret key) — it controls your account
- Report bugs via the in-app feedback found on the gear icon. 

*Self-custody means self-responsibility. That's empowering.*

## 🎯 What Is This?

Think [UDisc](https://udisc.com), but with **freedom technology**:

- **🥏 Disc Golf Scorekeeping** — Track rounds with friends, just like you'd expect
- **⚡ Instant Bitcoin Settlement** — Round entries and prize pools settle automatically. No waiting. No chasing people down.
- **🔑 Self-Sovereign Identity** — Your Nostr key = your identity. No account creation. No password resets. No Big Tech overlords.
- **🌐 Serverless Architecture** — Runs on distributed Nostr relays. Nobody can shut it down. *Nobody can censor your disc golf game.*

### Why Does Disc Golf Need Bitcoin?

Every disc golfer knows the chaos:
- Tournament directors juggling cash, Venmo, and PayPal
- Payment app delays and holds
- The guy who "forgot his wallet" and will "get you next time"
- League organizers spending more time on spreadsheets, collecting payments and counting scores than throwing discs

**On-Chain Disc Golf fixes this.** Round entries are collected automatically when players join. Settlement happens instantly when the round ends. No human required.

## 🛠️ How It Works (The Nerdy Bit)

### The Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| **Identity** | [Nostr](https://nostr.com) | Decentralized identity. You own your keys, you own your account. |
| **Payments** | [Breez SDK](https://breez.technology) + [Lightning](https://lightning.network) | Self-custodial Lightning wallet built right into the app |
| **Data** | Nostr Relays | Serverless. Your rounds sync across relays worldwide. |
| **Static Address** | [Breez](https://breez.technology) | Human-readable Lightning address: `yourname@breez.tips` |
